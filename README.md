This project is a **Twitter Trending Topics Scraper** that uses Selenium WebDriver for scraping and a React frontend to display trending topics. Users can manually log in to Twitter, and the backend script will scrape the trending topics. The results are displayed on the frontend in a clean and responsive UI built with React and Tailwind CSS.
